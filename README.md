TASK 2 
 AGE  AND EMOTION DEDECTION THROUGH VOICE FOR MACHINE LEARNNG
 Age and Emotion Detection through voice:
 Description: In this task, you will develop a machine learning model to detect a person’s age from a voice note.
 The model should only process male voices; if a female voice is detected, it should reject the input and display a message saying, “Upload male voice.” 
 If the person’s age is more than 60, the model should mark them as a senior citizen and detect their emotioN . 
 For individuals below 60, the model should only detect their age. Guidelines: 
 This task is designed to test your logic-building and problem-solving skills.
 We encourage you to embrace the challenge and view it as an opportunity to grow.
 Please create your own machine learning model and ensure it includes a graphical user interface (GUI).
 While accuracy is important, we will evaluate your work based on the overall performance of your model and the successful functionality of your GUI.
